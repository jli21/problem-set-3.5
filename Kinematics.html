    <h1 class = "colorBlue">Calculus and it's application in Physics</h1>
    <p class = "white blue-bg">Calculus has numerous applications, particularly in physics. Calculus is
    used in fields such as kinematics, thermodynamics, and rotation.
    From the creation of calculus by Newton in the mid 17th century, caclulus
    has continued to develop and change the way we view the natural world. Physics
    is defined as the natural science that studies matter and its motion and behavior throughout time and space.

    <p>In this website, we will study the relationships between Calculus and Physics. </p>
