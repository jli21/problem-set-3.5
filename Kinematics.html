    <h3>Derivation of the kinematic equations</h3>
    <p class = "white blue-bg">Kinnematic formulas only apply when acceleration is constant. All objects are influenced by the earth's gravity, and kinnematics are used in many free fall problems. Kinnematics only analyzes the motion of an object, and the object's mass has no influence whatsoever on the motion of the object in kinnematics.</p>
